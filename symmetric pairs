You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.


SELECT DISTINCT f1.x, f1.y
FROM functions f1
INNER JOIN functions f2
    ON f1.x = f2.y 
    AND f1.y = f2.x
WHERE f1.x < f1.y
OR f1.x IN( SELECT x
            FROM functions
            WHERE x = y
            GROUP BY x,y
            HAVING count(*) >1)
ORDER BY f1.x
